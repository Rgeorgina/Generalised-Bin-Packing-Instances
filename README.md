# Generalised-Bin-Packing-Instances
This repository contains benchmark instances of the generalised bin packing problem (GBPP) and its variant. Please see the original paper by Baldi et al. (2012) on "The generalized bin packing problem", Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 48(6), 1205--1220, for more detailed description of the problem.
The files "class_0" to "class_3" contain hyperlinks to the text files of all benchmark instances for the GBPP. The file "GBPPI_instances" contains the benchmark instances utilised in the paper by Baldi et al. (2019) on "A generalized bin packing problem for parcel delivery in last-mile logistics", European Journal of Operational Research, 274(3), 990--999.
